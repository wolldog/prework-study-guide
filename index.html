        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language or HTML is one of 3 key languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>HTML provides the framework for the webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements, each with a distinct role. Some elements contain content, others provide information.</li>
          <li>The 'head' element provides information or 'metadata' for the browser to ensure the page renders correctly.</li>
          <li>Information in the 'head' element is not visible to the user.</li>
          <li>'!DOCTYPE html', the first line in an HTML document, is a declaration to tell the browser that is is looking at an HTML document.</li>
          <li>The 'title' element is required and will be displayed in the tab at the top of the page.</li>
          <li>The 'meta' element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author and viewport.</li>
          <li>The 'link' element tells the browser where to find any external resouce required. For example an external stylesheet.</li>
          <li>The 'body' element sets out the structure and contains the visible content of the webpage.</li>
          <li>The h1 through h6 elements represent levels of heading. 'h1' is the largest and most prominent. There should only be one 'h1' in a document.</li>
          <li>'ul' and 'ol' elements represent unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists. The 'li' element is a list item.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element; tags and content. Tags are just what appears inside the angle bracket.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements are elements whose name describes the content.</li>
          <li>It is best practice to use semantic elements wherever possible as it makes your HTML easier to read.</li>      
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are know as 'child' elements.</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the other elements is called the 'parent'.</li>
          <li>A well structured HTML document will be user friendly and easy to navigate.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are case sensitive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS styling can be achieved in 3 ways; inline, internal or external.</li>
          <li>A CSS rule has a 'selector' and a 'declaration'.</li>
          <li>The selector identifies which element the style should apply to.</li>
          <li>The declaration specifes a property and assigns a value to the property.</li>
          <li>Each HTML element is essentially a box with a margin (outside) and padding (inside).</li>
          <li>A '*' selector can be used to style every element on a page.</li>
          <li>If two or more elements share the same styling you can combine their rules.</li>
          <li>If using a seperate document to add style you need to incorporate a link in the 'head' element of the HTML doc.</li>
          <li>When you don't want to style all instances of an element in the same way, use a 'class' attribute.</li>
          <li>Choose a word that will best describe where the style should be used, then precede it with a full stop, ie. '.card'</li>
          <li>Incorporate the class attribute in the opening tag of the element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is the most commonly used version control software among developers.</li>
          <li>Git allows multiple developers to work on a project without overwriting each others work. </li>
          <li>Git tracks all changes and makes it possible to revert to an earlier version of code if an error is introduced.</li>
          <li>You can use Git on your local machine to track changes but it is usually used in conjunction with a remote cloud based repository like GitHub.</li>
          <li>To access Git we used the command line.</li>
          <li>Git works using a system called Git branching. </li>
          <li>The files and folders that contain the code and assets for a project reside on the 'main' branch.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to contribute to a project, they copy the main branch to a feature branch. They make changes on the feature branch, never the main branch.</li>
          <li>Once changes have been vetted and reviewed in the feature branch, the files are merged back into the main branch.</li>
          <li><b>git status</b> checks what branch we are currently on and list any current changes.</li>
          <li><b>git checkout [branch name]</b> moves you from the branch you are on to another named branch. </li>
          <li><b>git checkout -b [branch-name]</b> creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li><b>git add [filename]</b> adds the named file to a staging area ready for the next commit.</li>
          <li><b>git commit</b> captures a snapshot of the currently staged changes.</li>
          <li><b>git pull origin main</b> pulls a fresh copy of the original files from the origin main branch. </li>
          <li><b>git commit -m "Description of changes"</b> commits (saves) the changes you have added to the staging area along with a description. </li>
          <li><b>git push origin [feature branch name]</b>pushes changes in our locally stored feature branch to a remote branch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Application Programming Interfaces or APIs built atop the core JavaScript language provide enormous functionality in a plug n play fashion.</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values.</li>
          <li>Variables can hold values from many data types; String, Number, Boolean, Array and Object.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive so MyVariable is not the same as myvariable.</li>
          <li>Comments can be inserted in code to assist understanding. /* Anything between the slashes including over line breaks is ignored */ </li>
          <li>An 'operator' is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two variables.</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression is true or false for example; if.....else.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse.</li>
          <li>Some functions are built into the browser but you can write your own.</li>
          <li>Events are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, for example, a 'click' event executes a function when you click on something.</li>
